		'Henriëtte Bosmans (1895 - 1952) was a Dutch pianist and composer. She frequently performed with Concertgebouw Orchestra as a concert pianist with the conductor Willem Mengelberg. Before World War II, her career as a pianist in The Netherlands prospered, due to the cancellations of foreign musicians. Bosmans began studying music theory and composition with Jan Willem Kersbergen and Willem Pijper, and instrumentation with Cornelis Dopper. She published her first works is as early as 1917, when she was 23. Her international breakthrough as a composer came in 1938 when Willem Noske (violin) performed her music in Paris and Prague. Her career came to a halt during the war - due to her partly Jewish origin, she was considered an "undesirable". After the war, she continued to compose and work closely with musicians such as Jo Vincent and Noémie Perugia. She composed until 1951, a year before her death. Her works includes songs, orchestral and chamber music.',

		'Our ever-changing world is reflected in music and art. Gender and race are topic that bring change in our society today and we wish to be a part of them. Our patron, Henriëtte Bosmans, was celebrated for being one of the most successful pianists and composers in the Netherlands during her lifetime. We are fascinated by her life story and the difficulties she had to face to gain recognition as a female composer of Jewish origin during  World War II. Unfortunately, today her works are rarely performed. We would like to honour her talent and dedication by performing her music.',
